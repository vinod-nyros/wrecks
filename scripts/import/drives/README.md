Import Drives
=============

- Starting point is in Google Docs (OK, Drive, now) - 

- "WD Hard Drives Feb 2015" is here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h27RXtDlnA6a_EHBm1BYWZAi_Lul_uJHfHB_mxgNMxk/edit#gid=0

- wd-drives.py is customized based on the idiosyncrasies of the results there, and produces around 50 results to import.

- wd-drives.csv is the ourput file, ready for CSVImport.

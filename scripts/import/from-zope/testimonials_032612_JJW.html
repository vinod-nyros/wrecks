I truly appreciate everything your company has done for me,
especially Max and James.  I'm a fully-converted Linux/Ubuntu
promoter and "prophet" now, and I tell everyone who'll listen not
only about why they should consider a Linux/Ubuntu desktop as their
own next PC, but I tell them everything I can about how fine a
company eRacks is!

Just a quick note to say that our new servers are up and running now.
We are very pleased with them - they are really very quiet! The noise
difference between them and the Dell Poweredge 750 servers we originally
used is incredible!  Thanks for the great service,"</i> TP, from the UK.

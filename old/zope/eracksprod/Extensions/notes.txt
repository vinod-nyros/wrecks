1) Walk the zope tree & unroll everything w/o a z to eracks.com, and 
have the z-prefix go to eracks.net - and leave the eracks.net site intact, too, as straight zope!
2) zope templating for site factory..
3) python webdav client for posting to zope, along w/jython editor

after running 3/8:  really need to have the obejcts render themselves, 
perhaps with a renderer object - that way you can put it in the session 
tree, and just call it.  The fundamental difference thought through 
yesterday, is the dict-tree object rendering select tags, and the objects 
being isa or hasa UserDict. V3.

could be bold if you like.

3. I would like to change "review order" to "confirm order".  To me, the
word review sounds like a back button, not a forward-type action.  I'll make
a confirm order button with an arrow, I think, in case you agree.

states & scenarios:

1) user surfs to form anew
        fromuser = 0
        ok = 0
        render for input, put nothing in session

2) user sends form 
        fromuser = 1
        ok = 0 on way in, ok = 1 on way out iff no errors
        render for output iff ok, else render for input with errors hilited

3) user returns to form anew after surfing away, (has valid session data)
        fromuser = 0
        ok = 0/1 on way in, recheck edits, ok = 1 on way out iff no errors
        render same as 2

4) user sends form, with some completed sections (ok=1)
        fromuser = 1
        ok same as 2/3, master ok on way out, iff all forms ok
        render same as 2/3, inc step iff master ok

issue: valid fields that don't appear in request - i.e., checkbox.

2/11 sun
 added frm member to fields - not quite a parent obj, but close - 
        and not the same as the frm's dict membership - 
        the dict membership is for field / session storage, the frm is for rendering

 how about renderleft, rendermiddle, renderright?  
  missing left or right colspans the 2
  - can use for form title
  - nested fields just override
  render usually renders row (all3), override in subfields
  what about in/out, though?  
  kind of need a location for the meat of the info, or a description 
  - a renderer class, or object, with in/out, visible when, location of info, tag(s), etc

2p v3,4,5 done! great stuff! separate form list/dict, kids/parent struct, intheform flag

todo:
form heading, error msgs
link

edits: 
 billing reqd iff cbox cleared
 state optional iff country
 tax required iff ca
 phone reqd iff 2day or 1day
 later: zip matches city, city determines tax, compute shipping

exception handling - 
 1) std zope err message, email copy 
 2) especially with the external method - return useful, graceful text

7p after running:
OK, britta wants one button for the whole page - 
 page class
 reword
 move cbox to shipping info
 no buttons
 central control, somehow

can fix cbox not updating with an action() method! 
 - 10p update: need OnFormReceived and OnRecieved or even OnClick to distinguish

hit url of er733 after successful compile - done!
integrate w/zope for debugging?


2/10 sat 
after running:
 rgroup class w/children using 'data' as parent ptr
 heir impl model instead of 2-level flat container/item model? but the req/ses is flat 
 nextrow method in form obj, call fm render in fields
 just do the ccard items in the row? no
 just create the exceptional objects manually?
 use the fieldlist method and creation engine as the basis for a factory object?
 button at upper right, in frame?

10p: 
 need a 'renderer' class heirarchy to render the fields - either hasa, or mult inh
 important: form class should mostly iterate and call field methods - most of get() 
	should be in the field method, for example!
 also, need to 'register' subforms' fields - requires parent/child heirarchy to be established - 
	maybe pass in at init, in engine?
 idea: use 'group' classes to group the next n classes in the list, by some criteria - same type, 
	starts with cc, etc. who registers?
 get() is the only one that really needs to be moved into the field.

12m sat/sun 2/10-2/11/01
 really trying to reimplement swi explorer/nav(i)gator - repr heir struc in html table
 
 a better oo impl would have a list to register into for the (flat) html form interactions, and 
 a 'contents' method to override for nested representations


2/9 fri after running:
 step object - 
  step [ 1 ] (table w/border around the number) - configure your eRacks system
  step [ 2 ] eRacks secure checkout pages - enter your information
  step [ 3 ] - Review and place your eRacks order
  step [ 4 ] - print your eRacks order receipt
 
 1) d allow black form fields
 2) fix nested forms 
 3) put fields in session when pass edits, put formname=1 when all edits passed
 4) form objects should have name, descr also
 5) allow session return, maybe force login again after 30 minutes?
 6) how to generate order id? Britta?

 use both styles and fonts and hlink/vlink

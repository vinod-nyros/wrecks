This directory will hold any additional Python packages installed into
this Zope instance.  Installing Distutils-based packages should be
done using the command:

  /usr/bin/python2.4 setup.py install --home /var/lib/zope2.10/instance/eracksprod

This will cause the newly installed Python packages to appear in this
directory.

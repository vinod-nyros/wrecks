      >PRLog</a> -</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\teRacks Open Source Systems announces a new\
      \ custom line of pre-configured desktop computers, rackmount servers, and NAS\
      \ Network Attached Storage servers available through Amazon. The new line was\
      \ designed and assembled by eRacks expert team of computer engineers in their\
      \ Southern California facility. Consumers will now have access to the same custom\
      \ built enterprise-level computer systems used by NASA, ILM (Industrial Light\
      \ &amp; Magic), Motorola, Sony, Google, and others. These systems were previously\
      \ unavailable to the general public. The entire line of systems is also fully\
      \ upgradeable. The ability to upgrade will typically extend the life of most\
      \ systems by several years, saving consumers substantial time and money.</p>\r\
      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\tOne of the highlights of the new Amazon storefront is the AresPro\
      \ Dual Xeon Sixteen Core desktop workstation. The AresPro line is the perfect\
      \ solution for engineers, video editors, high-end gamers, and graphic designers\
      \ seeking an affordable and entirely upgradeable system. The eRacks AresPro\
      \ line delivers more power, better graphics performance and more storage options\
      \ than anything else on the market. The sixteen core AresPro features a 1000watt\
      \ PSU, SuperMicro X9DAI-0 Motherboard, dual Intel Xeon E5-2650 2.0GHz eight-core\
      \ processor,32GB 1600MHz DDR3 Memory ,2 x 2TB SATA3 7200rpm hard drives, RAID\
      \ 1, Nvidia 560TI Graphics, Asus Xonar DG 5.1 Sound Card, Blueray Burner, and\
      \ Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit OS. All eRacks systems come with a Standard 1yr\
      \ full / 3yr Limited Warranty, which includes one full one year parts and labor,\
      \ and up to 3 years of individual components&#39; warranties as included by\
      \ the manufacturer.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAs always, the entire line of eRacks\
      \ systems is available online through eRacks website. Most of eRacks clients\
      \ prefer customized hardware and software configurations, and some even opt\
      \ to have eRacks configure a set of systems, staging it in-house before delivery.\

      \n\tGamers are not exactly the first group that comes to mind when one thinks\
      \ of Linux users. Yet <a href=\"http://eracks.com\">eRacks</a>, a PC vendor\
      \ specialized in open source systems, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/eracks-announces-arespro-line-high-performance-desktop-computers-070754619.html\"\
      >recently launched</a> a new line of high end desktops, called AresPro, aimed\
      \ at gamers and other customers with specific needs for powerful computers.\
      \ Here&#39;s the scoop, and its meaning for the open source channel.\r\n\t<p>\r\
      \n\t\tAdmittedly, gamers are not the only group to whom eRacks &mdash; which\
      \ The VAR Guy himself <a href=\"http://www.thevarguy.com/the-open-source-50/up-and-comers/\"\
      >has identified</a> as a top up and coming open source company &mdash; hopes\
      \ to cater with its new systems. According to its press release, it has engineers,\
      \ graphic designers and video editors in mind as well. And the systems can be\
      \ purchased with either Microsoft Windows or a variety of open source operating\
      \ systems (or both, in a dual boot setup) preinstalled, meaning that many of\
      \ the gamers who purchase these PCs may simply be traditional Windows users.</p>\r\
      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\tBut it&#39;s notable nonetheless that an OEM specialized in hardware\
      \ designed for open source platforms has turned its attention to the gaming\
      \ crowd. Maybe eRacks has noticed that an increasing number of Linux games run\
      \ quite well using the <a href=\"http://www.winehq.org/\">Wine</a> emulator,\
      \ which makes Linux a more viable platform for gamers. (Sidenote: technically\
      \ &quot;<a href=\"http://wiki.winehq.org/Debunking_Wine_Myths\">Wine is not\
      \ an emulator</a>,&quot; but it&#39;s close enough.) Meanwhile other first rate\
      \ games with native Linux support, like <a href=\"http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/\"\
      >0 A.D.</a>, are <a href=\"http://www.thevarguy.com/2011/12/28/open-source-game-0-a-d-again-seeking-cash-for-programmers/\"\
      >in development</a> and may well mean that Windows will cease to be the near\
      \ exclusive domain of the gaming crowd that it has traditionally been.</p>\r\
      \n\t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tAresPro Features</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIn any case,\
      \ whether their chief concern is gaming, engineering, design or something else,\
      \ Linux users searching for high end PCs stand to be well pleased by eRacks&rsquo;s\
      \ new offering. The AresPro machines boast 16 core CPUs and up to 768 gigabytes\
      \ of memory (which, I&#39;ll add, is a mind-boggling figure &mdash; back when\
      \ I built my first PC in 2001, I thought I was a huge deal rocking half a gigabyte\
      \ of RAM), along with the high end video cards, SSD storage, liquid cooling\
      \ and other fancy features that one expects on PCs of that caliber.</p>\r\n\t\
      <div class=\"c9\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://eracks.com/products/Desktops/config?sku=ARESPRO\"\
      ><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/press/arespro_136x300.jpeg\" /></a><br />\r\n\t\
      \tAresPro PC</div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\teRacks promises that the machines will support\
      \ Windows 7, as well as a range of popular Linux distributions and some of the\
      \ BSDs. A company representative with whom I spoke, however, reported that most\
      \ AresPro orders so far have been for Windows, a trend that the company anticipates\
      \ to continue. But he added that &ldquo;our sales team will definitely offer\
      \ dual boot options to anyone who wants it at no extra charge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\
      \t<p class=\"c8\">\r\n\t\tHigh End PCs and Open Source</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\
      It shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone, of course, if most of the AresPro machines\
      \ end up running only Windows. But the simple fact that eRacks is offering state\
      \ of the art PCs to the open source crowd is notable, since typically the only\
      \ high performance machines available with Linux or one of the BSDs preloaded\
      \ are intended to be used as servers, not desktops. A few other OEMs, like <a\
      \ href=\"http://zareason.com/shop/home.php\">ZaReason</a> and <a href=\"http://www.system76.com/\"\
      >System76</a>, offer high-spec&#39;d desktop machines with Linux preinstalled,\
      \ but the selection nonetheless remains limited.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe AresPro\
      \ announcement is thus good news for those open source users who want high end\
      \ PCs without paying the Windows tax. It&#39;s also a plus for the open source\
      \ channel as a whole, which needs all the love from hardware vendors that it\
      \ can get.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n", created: !!timestamp '2012-10-21 17:37:30.929236',

      \t\t\t<b>Site and Service Updates</b><br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe also send the user\
      \ site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe\
      \ from service announcements, which contain important information about the\
      \ service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in\
      \ regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p>\r\n\t\t\
      \t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b><br />\r\
      \n\t\t\t\t\tIf a user&#39;s personally identifiable information changes (such\

      \n\t\t<h4>\r\n\t\t\tMounting Hardware</h4>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tRackmount systems\
      \ can be simply bolted to the rack-shelf at the front panel, or for heavier\
      \ systems, rear/center brackets can add additional support.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\
      \n\t\t\tRackmount servers can also be attached to the rack shelf using sliding\
      \ rails to allow the system to move similarly to a drawer. This is useful for\
      \ repair/upgrade purposes, when the top of the chassis must be removed.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tNote the depth of the rack shelf unit as well as the rackmount\
      \ system, when planning installation. Rack shelf depth is not standard, although\
      \ depths of 39.4 inches (1,000 mm) is becoming more common in larger installations.\
      \ At the widest shelf depth, some servers can be mounted both in the front and\
      \ back.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMost audio rack-shelves are shallower than general\
      \ computer rack-shelves, and are in the range of 15 - 21 inch depth. It is sometimes\
      \ possible to mount a system that hangs out the back of a rack-shelf, but not\
      \ of course, for the closed shelf units. eRacks has shallow-depth chassis available\
      \ for audio rack shelves, including the <a href=\"http://eracks.com/products/config?sku=SHORT\"\
      >eRacks/SHORT</a> and the <a href=\"http://eracks.com/products/config?sku=LITE\"\

      \n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNote that some vendors purposely build non-standard\
      \ rackmount servers, cabinets, mounting hardware and equipment, requiring the\
      \ purchaser to buy the rack-shelf and/or mounting kits from same vendor. This\
      \ is a vendor lock-in business strategy that eRacks has always strongly opposed.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\teRacks&#39; systems are all industry-standard, as\
      \ well as the components within each system. No non-standard rack-mounting equipment\

      When The VAR Guy launched his website in January 2008, our resident blogger\
      \ kept a super close eye on open source channel partner programs. At one point,\
      \ The VAR Guy published the &lt; href=&quot;http://www.thevarguy.com/the-open-source-50/&quot;&gt;Open\
      \ Source 50 &mdash; tracking how the top open source companies were working\
      \ with VARs and IT service providers. So whatever happened to each of the 50\
      \ companies in that annual list? Some are dead, some are thriving, and many\
      \ have repositioned for cloud computing, Big Data and other buzz words. Here&rsquo;s\
      \ a belated update from The VAR Guy in alphabetical order&hellip;\r\n\t<p>\r\
      \n\t\t1. Acquia: The Drupal specialist still has a partner program for service\
      \ providers, and Drupal&rsquo;s popularity as a content management platform\
      \ has grown extensively.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t2. Actuate: Still focused on the\
      \ Eclipse BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools) open source project.</p>\r\
      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\t3. Alfresco Software Inc.: Still promoting itself as the leading\
      \ open source alternative to enterprise content management. Now managing more\
      \ than 6.6 million users and 3.3 billion documents worldwide.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\
      \n\t\t4. Astaro Corp.: Once positioned as an a unified threat management (UTM)\
      \ system that leveraged open source. Now owned by Sophos, the endpoint security\
      \ and anti-virus company.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t5. Canonical: The Ubuntu promoter\
      \ has pushed beyond desktop Linux to promote server and cloud options for channel\
      \ partners and customers. Still a well-known name, but the rise of tablets and\
      \ smartphones running Apple iOS and Google Android seems to have stolen some\
      \ of Ubuntu&rsquo;s spotlight. Memo to Director of Communications Gerry Carr:\
      \ Let&rsquo;s catch up.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t6. ClearCenter: Still positioning\
      \ itself as a provider of an open software platform for running Server, Network,\
      \ &amp; Gateway services. Recently announced a relationship with Zarafa, the\
      \ open source email system. It has been awhile since The VAR Guy spoke with\
      \ ClearCenter CEO Michael Proper. How&rsquo;s life, Michael?</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\
      \t\t7. Cleversafe: The storage company, launched in 2004, had a strong open\
      \ source market presence but appeared to change directions around September\
      \ 2010, when open source related forums were removed from its website. These\
      \ days, Cleversafe describes itself as a company that solves big data storage\
      \ problems, with no mention of open source.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t8. Compiere\
      \ Inc.: Consona acquired Compiere, an open source ERP specialist, in 2010. The\
      \ old Compiere website is still online, but channel partners would be wise to\
      \ visit the Consona&rsquo;s Compiere landing page.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t9. Continuent\
      \ Inc.: Still focused on database replication technology, particularly for Oracle\
      \ and MySQL environments &mdash; plus a channel partner program for VARs.</p>\r\
      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\t10. Digium Inc.: Promoter of Asterisk, the open source IP PBX.\
      \ Most recently launched its own line of IP phones, giving channel partners\
      \ end-to-end unified communications solutions for customers. But The VAR Guy\
      \ wonders: Will Digium ever launch its own Asterisk offering in the cloud? Hmmm&hellip;</p>\r\

      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\t16. Fluendo SA: Still focused on multi-media solutions for open\

      \ Open Source (GWOS): Now known more simply as GroundWork Inc., still focused\
      \ on IT monitoring solutions but various partner program efforts (including\

      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\t18. Ingres Corp.: The open source database provider repositioned\
      \ as Actian Corp. in September 2011 to focus on a cloud development platform\
      \ for consumer style apps. The rebranding came about three months after Ingres\
      \ (er, Actian) had changed CEOs.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t19. Intalio Inc.: Still\

      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\t30. MySQL: The open source database is now owned by Oracle, and\

      \ business under Attachmate&rsquo;s ownership, free of Novell&rsquo;s shadow.</p>\r\
      \n\t<p>\r\n\t\t32. Nuxeo: Still positioning itself as an open source enterprise\
      \ content management system. Double revenues in 2011, and Nuxeo announced 12\
      \ new SI partners and 9 new technology partners.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t33. Open-Xchange:\

      \ $1 billion open source company a few months ago.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t38. rSmart:\
      \ Promoter of open source management software for colleges. Things have been\

      \ to consolidate vast amounts of data, improve network reliability, save office\
      \ space, reduce energy consumption and strengthen network security. The recent\
      \ Mac Flashback virus has proved that any system is vulnerable to attack. The\

      \ and other storage-needy applications.&quot; The NAS50 is already being used\
      \ by NASA and several major national networks and engineers for data retention,\
      \ cloud storage, storing uncompressed media files, and creating multiple backups.</p>\r\

      \ a maximum of two eight-core Intel Xeon or four AMD Opteron CPUs for a total\
      \ of 16 Intel cores or 64 AMD cores. Memory can be upgraded up to 768GB DDR3\
      \ and multiple RAID arrays can be configured. eRacks also offers 4GbE and 10GbE\
      \ network interfaces for the eRacks/NAS50 server. An external SAS option enables\
      \ multiple NAS50 servers or other NAS units together for peta-scale storage.</p>\r\

      \ owner and founder Joseph Wolff says, &quot;Our new Eseries line truly breaks\
      \ through previous price/performance barriers, gives our customers the highest\
      \ processing power available, and raises the bar for unprecedented server operating\
      \ efficiency and &#39;Green&#39; energy-efficient features.&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t\
      \t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tThe new Intel powered servers by eRacks are a perfect upgrade\

      \ The SANDYTOWER includes the blazing fast Xeon E5-2600 series by Intel and\
      \ is expandable up to 128 GB RAM. Businesses will easily be able to upgrade\
      \ their servers as they grow. The ability to upgrade and expand their servers,\

      >PRWEB</a>,\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tSummary: eRacks Open Source Systems announces\
      \ expansion of its rackmount server lineup with customized blade server models.\
      \ Several configurations are available including a twin blade system capable\
      \ of 20 nodes per 7U of rackmount height.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks announces\
      \ a new category of blade server configurations in its rackmount server lineup.\
      \ Blade server technology is an efficient way to scale server capacity while\
      \ limiting space and power needs.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tBlades are primarily\
      \ suitable for high density server farms, where efficiency and cost-to-operate\
      \ are significant. Each of eRacks blade servers has its own memory, CPUs, GPUs,\
      \ hard drives, and network connections, and can be hot-swapped. Several blade\
      \ servers reside together in one enclosure which provides the power and cooling\
      \ for the set. An eRacks fully-populated blade enclosure can house between 10\
      \ and 14 blades, including twin-node blades. Populated with the eRacks/TBLADE\
      \ twin-node blade server, a density of 20 dual-processor nodes in a 7U rackmount\
      \ height is reached.</p>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\tAdvantages of blade rackmounts\
      \ over standard rackmount servers:\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t1 - Reliability -\
      \ Redundant servers, power supplies, and RAID drives, are all designed with\
      \ hotswap capability. One server or drive or power supply can be removed without\
      \ bringing down the others.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t2 - Space efficiency\
      \ - Server density can more than twice that of traditional 1U rackmount servers.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t3 - Cable reduction - The BLADE10 and BLADE14 enclosures\
      \ provide network, power, and KVM cabling reduction. Keeping cabling simpler\
      \ reduces management time and errors.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t4 - Lower\
      \ power consumption and operating costs - By eliminating the overhead of discrete\
      \ 1U servers, power consumption and electricity costs are significantly decreased.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t5 - Faster troubleshooting, without downtime - Power\
      \ supplies, drives, blades, all can be hot-swapped.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\
      \t\t6 - Disaster management - Redundant power modules in each enclosure are\
      \ designed to provide a failover, maintaining uptime.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\
      \t\t\t7 - Remote management - eRacks blades servers have integrated IPMI2.0\
      \ (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) and KVM (Kernel-based Virtual\
      \ Machine).</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t8 - Scalability - Once a blade server\
      \ chassis has been installed, additional servers can be added by simply sliding\
      \ them into the bays while the system is running.</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\
      <p>\r\n\t\t\tCombining blade technology with software virtualization allows\
      \ incredible advantages in modularization, which in turn, can make it simpler\
      \ to scale. Virtualization allows each application to reside in its own environment,\
      \ including the operating system and software best suited to its tasks. eRacks\
      \ experts can also configure servers with the customer&#39;s choice of virtualization\
      \ software or other software especially designed to scale, such as Apache Hadoop.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tAn optimal infrastructure that maximizes density, plus has\
      \ ability to scale, will also provide a smaller footprint resulting in environmental\
      \ benefits and cost savings. eRacks Blade Enclosures&#39; power supplies have\
      \ 94% power efficiency with a highly effective cooling subsystem design. Each\
      \ blade also has integrated IPMI2.0 with remote KVM, capable of full remote\
      \ management, for peace of mind. Network options include Infiniband DDR/QDR\
      \ and 10G Ethernet, which are available on every blade model. While most resellers\
      \ offer only a general blade model, eRacks offers a variety of configurations\
      \ for differing applications.</p>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\teRacks Blade models\
      \ include:\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t- eRacks/XBLADE, an Intel Xeon-based, Quad-core\
      \ / Six-core, Single / Dual CPU server supporting up to six drives.</p>\r\n\t\
      \t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t- eRacks/ABLADE, an AMD Opteron-based Single, Dual, or Quad-CPU\
      \ blade server. Density can be up to 640 cores per 7U.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\
      \t\t\t- eRacks/YBLADE, a Xeon blade for more processor-intensive applications\
      \ that can scale to a density of 14 servers per 7U.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\
      \t\t- eRacks/RENDERBLADE, which holds two graphic cards per blade.</p>\r\n\t\
      \t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t- eRacks/TBLADE, a twin-node blade server capable of a 20-node,\
      \ 2.56TB memory per 7U.</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMax Haskvitz,\
      \ eRacks Operations Manager says, &quot;eRacks prides itself on offering standard\
      \ blade servers that are interoperable, rather than resorting to the proprietary\
      \ lock-in practices of other blade vendors such as HP and Dell. We also strive\
      \ to demystify blade technology, and assist our customers in planning their\
      \ infrastructure.&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tMost of eRacks clients prefer\
      \ customized hardware and software configurations, and some even opt to have\
      \ eRacks configure a set of systems, staging it in-house before delivery. For\
      \ more information visit the eRacks website: http://www.eracks.com or call (714)\
      \ 532-5322. eRacks offers educational and bulk discounts.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\

      >PRWEB</a>,\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tSummary: eRacks releases upgraded configurations\
      \ of rackmount server models, available online.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks\
      \ Open Source Systems has revamped and upgraded the configurations of their\
      \ General Purpose category rackmount servers. In spite of component shortages\
      \ and rising prices due to the flooding of hard drive factories in Thailand,\
      \ eRacks has increased the capacities of components in their online computer\
      \ server models, while keeping prices level.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks\
      \ Open Source Systems, based in Orange, California, offers rackmount servers\
      \ and computers, and has an increasingly large following among Linux users and\
      \ other Open Source advocates. Customized rackmount servers are eRacks&#39;\
      \ main products, but selections of Linux desktops and laptops are also available\
      \ online. eRacks&#39; latest refresh includes AMD&#39;s Bulldozer Interlagos\
      \ processors, and Intel&#39;s Sandy Bridge, and Ivy Bridge series in the General\
      \ Purpose line-up. Desktop and Quiet System users can also benefit from the\
      \ new socket 2011 and FM1 systems featuring the FX line from AMD and the Sandy\
      \ Bridge E for Intel. Also the cards from LSI, Fusion IO, 3ware, and Intel allow\
      \ many storage and communication options. Combining all that together with the\
      \ ability of GbE to 4, 20,40 and 100GbE connectivity, as well as all forms of\
      \ wireless, really allow this line-up to sparkle.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe\
      \ entry-level eRacks/VALUE rackmount server starts at $595, and features a choice\
      \ of Intel Celeron or i3 CPU. All General Purpose models are configured with\
      \ SATA3 hard drives as the default, with SSD included in the options. The eRacks/SERVE\
      \ model is AMD-based, features the Athlon AM3 CPU and is configurable for most\
      \ server tasks. For more intensive computational demands, the eRacks/PREMIUM\
      \ rackmount server is configurable with Intel i5/i7 CPU or Xeon E3 and up to\
      \ 32GB DDR3 memory.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe highest-end server in this lineup\
      \ is eRacks/ENTERPRISE, useful for high-demand applications like Hadoop, Gluster,\
      \ Oracle, etc. It features Quad-core and six-core processors, four hot-swap\
      \ drives and up to 64 GB of DDR3 memory. All eRacks systems are fully configurable\
      \ and installed and tested with a wide choice of Open Source operating systems.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tOperations Manager, Max Haskvitz, remarks, &quot;eRacks prides\
      \ itself on always offering our customers the leading technology, with the added\
      \ value of knowing with certainty that your server is fully qualified and certified\
      \ with all the latest open-source software stacks available.&quot;</p>\r\n\t\
      \t<p>\r\n\t\t\tAll eRacks systems are built to customer specifications, including\
      \ options such as Quietization(tm) for environments that are sensitive to system\
      \ sound. eRacks installs and configures the customer&#39;s choice of operating\
      \ system, including Ubuntu Linux, Red Hat(tm), Fedora Linux or other Linux distribution,\
      \ *BSD or Sun&#39;s Open Solaris, as well as additional open source software.</p>\r\

      \n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tSummary: eRacks, a provider of configured open source rackmount\
      \ servers, announces three levels of redundant firewall systems, called the\
      \ TWINGUARD series. Each system contains two complete servers, automatically\
      \ providing a failover should one server go down.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks\
      \ announces its latest line of fully-redundant dual firewalls, the TWINGUARD,\
      \ TWINGUARD.PRO and TWINGUARD.ENTERPRISE rackmount servers. The Twinguard series\
      \ minimizes risk in mission critical networks where failure is never an option.\
      \ When one firewall fails, the other kicks in immediately, meaning no lost connectivity.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tWhen a network must be online and maintained 24 hours a day,\
      \ it&#39;s crucial to ensure that there are no single points of failure. Redundancy\
      \ is vital for a firewall, one of the most important components in most networks.\
      \ A failure in a firewall can spell sudden disaster, interrupting access to\
      \ an entire network.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tTwinguard series systems come in\
      \ three flavors. TWINGUARD, the most basic option, utilizes three gigabit ethernet\
      \ ports per node and dual core Intel Atom processors, providing maximum value\
      \ for smaller networks. Next is the TWINGUARD.PRO, which also sports three gigabit\
      \ NICs as well as Intel Core 2 Duo processors for more moderately-sized networks\
      \ requiring moderate computational power. Finally, the TWINGUARD.ENTERPRISE\
      \ provides three 10GbE ports and Intel Xeon processors, providing blazing fast\
      \ network connections and speedy CPUs, appropriate for large enterprise-scale\
      \ networks where high bandwidth and computational power are a must.</p>\r\n\t\
      \t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe eRacks/TWINGUARD runs the user&#39;s choice of OpenBSD or\
      \ FreeBSD and utilizes CARP and PFSync software for full redundancy. Since OpenBSD\
      \ and FreeBSD are open source, the eRacks/TWINGUARD, aside from bringing rock\
      \ solid performance and reliabity to the table, also saves the consumer money\
      \ that would have otherwise been spent on expensive software licenses. As an\
      \ added benefit, users enjoy the added security inherent in openly developed\
      \ software based on open standards.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks has been\
      \ on the forefront of technology for over ten years, and strives to ensure that\
      \ the latest and greatest is always available to users of open source software.\
      \ eRacks builds custom systems to order, and offers educational discounts and\
      \ bulk discounts. For more information, visit http://www.eracks.com or call\
      \ their USA-based customer service at (714) 532-5322.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\

      >eRacks/SANDYCORE</a></div>\r\n\t\t\teRacks announces a new rackmount server\
      \ model, the eRacks/SANDYCORE, available now. It utilizes the Sandy Bridge CPU,\
      \ Intel&#39;s second generation of 32nm Core processors, offering performance\
      \ boosts for graphics and computational intensive applications.\r\n\t\t\t<div>\r\
      \n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOrange, CA (PRWEB) February 28, 2011 -- eRacks Open\
      \ Source Systems unveils the eRacks/SANDYCORE, a new rackmount server model\
      \ based on Intel&#39;s newest Sandy Bridge CPU architecture.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\
      <p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSandy Bridge CPUs are currently available in either dual-core\
      \ or quad-core flavors, with 6-core and 8-core models coming later in the year.\
      \ Base models sport clock speeds as high as 3.4GHz and can be overclocked to\
      \ 3.8GHz using Intel&#39;s Turbo Boost Technology. Enthusiasts who want to push\
      \ their CPUs further can opt for the K series, which features an unlocked multiplier,\
      \ allowing the clock to be driven as fast as 5.7GHz. In addition to fast clock\
      \ speeds, Intel&#39;s latest line executes instructions roughly twice as fast\
      \ as previous models. All Sandy Bridge CPUs introduce a new set of instructions,\
      \ dubbed AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions), for floating point intensive calculations,\
      \ which will significantly improve the performance of applications designed\
      \ to take advantage of it. All Sandy Bridge processors come with a whopping\
      \ 8MB of L3 cache, and future processors to be released in the fourth quarter\
      \ of 2011 will possess as much as 20MB.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAll\
      \ of these exciting improvements by no means come at the cost of increased power\
      \ consumption. In fact, Sandy Bridge is more efficient in its use of energy\
      \ than its predecessors, which is great news for laptop owners who care about\
      \ conserving battery life as well as for the environmentally conscious.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWith so many cores, and with improved support for\
      \ floating point operations, the Sandy Bridge processor makes an ideal choice\
      \ for individuals interesting in editing video, rendering 3D graphics and even\
      \ playing games.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEarlier in the year, concerns\
      \ arose regarding a design flaw that effected the SATA2 ports on Sandy Bridge\
      \ motherboards. All affected models were recalled and have since been replaced\
      \ by boards that do not suffer from this problem. Thus, eRacks customers can\
      \ rest assured that they will be provided with reliable hardware.</p>\r\n\t\t\
      \t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe eRacks/SANDYCORE features open source software *by\
      \ default*, liberating the user from cumbersome and costly software licenses.\
      \ Operating system choices include all flavors of Linux and *BSD.</p>\r\n\t\t\
      \t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\teRacks Open Source Systems has been specializing in open\
      \ source solutions for over ten years. While eRacks prides itself on being a\

      \ server. With the new Opteron 6100 series they are able to squeeze up to 48\
      \ cores in a 1U system!The new 6100 Opteron 12 core has a massive 2 Billion\
      \ (with a B) transistors and 20MB of cache, it also has HT assist which helps\
      \ address the memory and threading within the CPU, add all that together with\
      \ only using 80-115W of power and you have a green, lean, computing machine.\
      \ This powerhouse system is perfect for the admin that needs massive raw horse\
      \ power, or data centers that require multiple cores.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe\
      \ OPTERNATOR also has 12 REAL cores per CPU not just logical ones, whereas Intel\
      \ has logical cores the OPTERNATOR has real hardware cores. This makes it ideal\
      \ for rendering complex scenes, for data mining, or for any other CPU hungry\
      \ application that needs to have its thirst sated. This is the most amount of\
      \ core in a 1U on the market today, and will probably be the benchmark for system\
      \ makers for years to come.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAdd in the options available\
      \ to the OPTERNATOR and you have a winner. With a maximum of 256GB of Memory,\
      \ RAID options, Remote management via an IPMI card, ISCSI support (optional),\
      \ hotswap bays, and the ability to add in a 10GbE or even 40GbE card (upcoming)\
      \ this will serve any need you can throw at it. eRacks also offers USB3 card\
      \ options, and plenty of room to expand in a 2U chassis for Graphics Cards (Telsa,\
      \ or FERMI), more Network cards, or even external ESATA3 connections.</p>\r\n\
      \t<p>\r\n\t\tIdeal places for this server would be databases, virtualization\
      \ setups, mass storage systems, rendering farms, and any other high processor\
      \ related application. Ideal for clusters of rackmount servers as well, or as\
      \ a head-unit in a storage array.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\teRacks continues to innovate\
      \ and expand on their server systems and will be at the forefront of technology\

      \ (Direct-Attached Storage) unit, also just 4U in height, yet with 88 drive\
      \ bays, in either a SATAII or SAS JBOD setup, that can be configured in RAID\
      \ formats as well. The DAS88 is also the largest single DAS unit on the market.\n\
      \                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Both devices\
      \ come with SAS expansion options, and feature a setup based around a double-sided\
      \ approach \_to storage. This breakthrough was made possible by eRacks advanced\
      \ cooling system and experience with network storage along with key partnerships\

      \ \_NAS72 and DAS88 were build to take into account rising energy costs and\
      \ are also tooled to be environmentally friendly as they utilize both the RoHS\
      \ approved components and a power supply that is rated as 93 percent efficient\
      \ compared to the industry standard of 75-80. The NAS72 system also has a smaller\
      \ footprint, but still offers between 30-50% more drive bays then most current\
      \ offerings in storage.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n   \
      \                 The NAS72 can also be configured for full redundancy, advanced\
      \ RAID and monitoring features, and of course full Linux/BSD support. Both the\
      \ DAS88 and the NAS72 include the flexibility to choose your interface of either\

      \                eRacks, one of the nation's largest open source computer related\
      \ manufacturer, is offering a special Cash for PC Clunkers programs that promises\
      \ discounts of up to $5000 for certain systems. The multi-thousand dollar discount\
      \ is available when a working system is traded in on one of eRacks highly rated\
      \ newer models.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n           \
      \         There are some minimum requirements to receive the maximum discount\
      \ and all the computers and systems that are traded-in are scheduled to be recycled.\
      \ Any parts still energy efficient enough to be viable will be reused by eracks\
      \ for internal purposes. The new systems also increase energy savings and efficiency\
      \ and are RoHS compatible, which is an added green perk for participants of\
      \ this program. Some units could be donated to local charities to assist in\
      \ spreading the open source movement. Another benefit is a customer relations\

      \ Storage) line of rackmount servers. The systems range from 8TB capacity in\
      \ a 4-drive 1U-height rackmount chassis to the behemoth 50-drive 9U system with\
      \ a capacity of 100TB. Data storage is a growing concern for data-heavy video\
      \ and other media-based files. Cloud and other enterprise storage servers are\
      \ the focus for these systems.\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks NAS systems incorporates\
      \ Western Digital&#39;s new Caviar Green 2TB drive, which uses less power and\
      \ is quieter than a typical hard drive. The large-capacity drives&#39; technology\
      \ include system-induced vibration reduction, spin-speed fine-tuning, and calculations\
      \ for optimally seeking speeds to lower power consumption, noise, and vibration.\
      \ Data reliability is achieved through a choice of RAID configurations of 10,\
      \ 5, 6, 1 or 0. RAID 6, striped disks with dual parity, makes it possible to\
      \ recreate data even under a double disk failure.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe\
      \ basic price of an eRacks server includes standard or customized file system\
      \ partitioning and RAID configuration. An extensive list of operating systems\
      \ are offered online. eRacks&#39; innovative NOSS (Network Operation System\
      \ Server) technology allows easy configuration with a choice of back-end storage\
      \ protocols automatically, including iSCSI &amp; NFS, AoE (ATA over Ethernet),\
      \ Samba / CIFS, and Appletalk.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks can install OpenFiler,\
      \ an open source alternative to the NetApp Filer, on request. OpenFiler supports\
      \ RAID, Fiber Channel, full iSCSI (target and initiator), point-in-time snapshots,\
      \ replication, and has a convenient Web-based GUI.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\

      \ February 23, 2009<br />\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks Open Source Systems announces\
      \ a new shallow-depth rackmount computer model, the eRacks/STUBBY, intended\
      \ for broadcast and audio studios as well as other applications where rack shelves\
      \ are limited in depth. This system is ideal for music, recording, and broadcast\
      \ studios, business applications requiring in-office or tabletop-racks, kiosks,\
      \ projection systems, and lectern or console installations.</p>\r\n\t\t<div>\r\

      >eRacks/STUBBY</a></div>\r\n\t\tThe eRacks/STUBBY computer measures 8.75 inches\
      \ in depth, fits 19 inch standard-width rackmount shelves, and is 1U in height,\
      \ or 1.75 inches. eRacks sells a selection of shallow-depth rackmount servers,\
      \ including low-power and silent systems. All eRacks systems are configured\
      \ with the customer&#39;s choice of operating system.\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThe\
      \ eRacks/STUBBY can be configured with a choice of Mini-ITX motherboards using\
      \ either a 1.6GHz single or dual core Intel Atom processor. The system is relatively\
      \ quiet, utilizing a 140 watt power supply and only one low-rotation-speed 40mm\
      \ chassis fan. If the application requires system noise to be at a minimum,\
      \ eRacks recommends replacement of the hard drive with a flash-based solid-state\
      \ drive (SSD). This configuration makes an excellent Linux rackmount Digital\
      \ Audio Workstation (DAW) for a recording studio.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\teRacks\
      \ has specialized in providing customized open source rackmount and desktop\

      \tThe recent economic upheaval has raised the level of urgency and reframed\
      \ the argument for open source software. Focus questions of IT have changed\
      \ from the likes of &#39;Should we consider open source software?&#39; to &#39;When\
      \ and how can we migrate our business applications to open source?&#39; Rapid\
      \ development and advances in open source software, in combination with growing\
      \ awareness of vendor lock-in with recurring license fees, have further contributed\
      \ to open source adoption.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFaced with flat or cut budgets, CIOs,\
      \ CTOs, and IT planners have been pushed out of their comfort zone. Many are\
      \ developing strategies to use open source software, avoiding expensive operating\
      \ costs. eRacks Open Source Systems reports orders for servers configured with\
      \ Linux and *BSD have risen significantly the last few months.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\
      \tBut it&#39;s not just about operating costs. Open source software returns\
      \ control to the user. It allows customization, avoids forced unneeded upgrades\
      \ and recurring license fees. Support for open source software is both freely\
      \ accessible and available for purchase. Red Hat, Sun Microsystems, EnterpriseDB,\
      \ MySQL and others now have corporate support programs for open source software.\
      \ Open source has long been prevalent in the web and back-end Internet services.\
      \ Now it is in common use in databases, CMS (Content Management Systems), and\
      \ other applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Having received multiple purchase\
      \ orders just in the last few weeks from organizations like University of Southern\
      \ California, Broadcom Corp., the US Army, the Dept of Energy, and NASA, we\
      \ see that open source has truly hit the mainstream in the server market,&quot;\
      \ comments Joseph Wolff, CEO of eRacks. One typical computer configuration requested\
      \ at eRacks is an Intel&reg; Core i7 CPU rackmount server, installed with Ubuntu,\
      \ Fedora, Centos, or Red Hat Linux. This high power system is often the first\
      \ choice for a server dedicated to the analysis of large data sets.</p>\r\n\

      \ its latest offering of both the 4 and the 8 CPU Westmere-EX processors in\
      \ its NAS line of servers. Earlier this year, Intel released two new lines of\
      \ Xeon processors, the E7-4800 series (for systems with up to four processors)\
      \ and the E7-8800 series (for systems with up to 8 processors), both codenamed\
      \ Westmere-EX. These CPUs sport a new socket (socket 1567), up to 10 cores per\
      \ processor (for a total of 20 threads of execution) and up to 30MB of cache.\n\
      \                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    The eRacks/NAS6X\
      \ sports as many as 40 cores and 512GB of RAM, whereas the eRacks/NAS16X sports\
      \ up to 80 cores and 1TB of RAM. Both systems are therefore ideal for any applications\
      \ that require massive parallelism and large quantities of memory. And, with\
      \ Intel claiming 40% greater performance as compared to the Xeon 7500 series,\
      \ the end user is assured more performance for less cost. Intel says that these\
      \ processors \"support massively scalable deployments and mission-critical workloads.\"\

      \ series are also more energy efficient than previous models, as various parts\
      \ of the CPU can now be shut down when not in use. This saves the end user money,\
      \ making the new Xeons a good investment.\n                  </p>\n        \

      >http://eRacks.com</a>) offers a choice of cost-effective 10GbE adapters to\
      \ a broad range of servers. Customized and preconfigured, rackmount server solutions\
      \ are also available including NAS (Network Attached Storage) systems.\r\n\t\
      \t<div>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tOrange, CA (PRWEB) April 29, 2011 -- April 29,\
      \ 2011 eRacks today announces the availability of 10 gigabit ethernet (10GbE)\
      \ across the board on its entire line of enterprise-grade servers, available\
      \ in three flavors: CX4, RJ-45 (both copper) or SFP+ (fiber optic.)</p>\r\n\t\
      \t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tPreviously, mainstream servers were limited to 1 gbps of\
      \ bandwidth per network adapter, forcing systems administrators to resort to\
      \ the cumbersome procedure of bonding NICs when more bandwidth was required.\
      \ Now, eRacks offers 10x that performance, all through a single port.</p>\r\n\
      \t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\teRacks offers a host of choices when deciding on a 10GbE\
      \ solution. Those who require only short range connections are free to choose\
      \ from CX4 or the fiber optic interface SFP+, and will most likely want SFP+\
      \ when a low-power low-latency connection is desired. Conversely, those who\
      \ require up to 100m of cabling will want to explore the RJ-45 option.</p>\r\
      \n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t10GbE is crucial for any system that needs to move large\
      \ amounts of data back and forth across a network. 10GbE makes a great foundation\
      \ for network attached storage, for example, and works exceptionally well with\
      \ technologies such as iSCSI. 10GbE is also highly useful for the rendering\
      \ of high definition audio and video across a network and can easily find a\
      \ home in any studio.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tNow is an ideal time to invest\
      \ in 10GbE, as costs are finally coming down and adoption is becoming much more\
      \ common.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tAbout eRacks Open Source Systems:<br />\r\
      \n\t\t\t\teRacks has been on the forefront of technology for over ten years\
      \ and strives to ensure that the latest and greatest in rackmount servers are\

      Orange, CA, USA<br />\r\n\tAugust 1, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Open Source\
      \ Systems announces a new virtualization host server, the eRacks / SUITE. This\
      \ powerhouse AMD dual Dual-Core Opteron rackmount server has ample storage and\
      \ hardware RAID. The system is qualified to enable hardware virtualization,\
      \ running virtual machines at near-native speeds. The pre-installed software\
      \ enables one system to do the work of several independent appliance servers\
      \ simultaneously. Virtualization is a compelling solution for those requiring\
      \ to maintain multiple environments, plan server consolidation, or create a\
      \ testing sandbox environment for new applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Open\
      \ Source Systems provides servers that are preinstalled with the virtualization\
      \ software as well as customers&#39; choices of virtual appliances. eRacks is\
      \ known for offering the widest choice of Open Source operating systems and\
      \ applications pre-installed with their rackmount servers. The eRacks / SUITE\
      \ model can be configured with open-source VMWare or Linux-native KVM (Kernel-based\
      \ Virtual Machine) virtualization software as well as a large number of possible\
      \ virtual operating systems and applications, including web, DNS, email, proxy\
      \ and other infrastructure services. eRacks&#39; technical team works individually\
      \ with each customer to arrive at the best configuration to meet the given requirements.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tCombined with the latest processors, virtualization is poised to\
      \ revolutionize network infrastructure design. Instead of isolating applications\
      \ in under-utilized individual machines, several virtual appliances can exist\
      \ in encapsulated images within one physical system. This partitioned server\
      \ is more cost-efficient and easier to manage than separate machines. Since\
      \ each virtual environment is hardware independent, and its image (operating\
      \ system, application, data and state) all reside within a single file, backups\
      \ are simple, and running on a different hardware platform is not a problem.\
      \ Hardware virtualization allows each virtual machine to run directly with the\
      \ compatible processor(s), avoiding the performance penalties of simulators.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tWith the host running Linux, it is possible to run multiple virtual\
      \ environments each running different operating systems, including legacy Windows\
      \ versions. Running a less stable operating system on a virtual machine instead\
      \ of a physical one, actually increases its availability since restarts are\
      \ simple and fast. Isolating unstable and easily-compromised software in virtual\
      \ environments provides increased security and fast recovery, as well. Virtualization\
      \ can also solve many disaster recovery issues, especially when downtime cost\
      \ is compared.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause the eRacks / SUITE server arrives with\
      \ the software already installed and tested, the system avoids any hardware\
      \ incompatibilities and is optimized and qualified for hardware virtualization.\
      \ Customized configurations comprise a large part of eRacks&#39; sales and many\
      \ systems are completed on a quote basis. eRacks also offers network design\
      \ assistance as well as consulting, available through their business alliances.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tAbout eRacks:<br />\r\n\teRacks Open Source Systems is the premier\
      \ provider of open source solutions and features its own rackmount servers,\

      \n\teRacks Open Source Systems is now offering Asus, MSI, and Acer Netbooks\
      \ preinstalled with Ubuntu or Fedora Linux. eRacks&#39; netbooks use Intel&#39;s\
      \ new Atom processor and are smaller, lighter, and more portable than laptops.\
      \ Netbooks are also significantly less expensive but can easily handle the daily\
      \ tasks like web-browsing, email, writing documents and spreadsheets. Other\
      \ vendors sell netbooks with a simplified version of Linux, such as Linpus,\
      \ but eRacks goes the extra step and configures the fully functional Linux operating\
      \ system on its netbooks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLinux is especially suited for netbooks,\
      \ whereas Microsoft Vista is considered to be too resource-intensive. The increasing\
      \ popularity of netbooks could be a significant step in the acceptance of open\
      \ source software in the mainstream. Google&#39;s Android, an open source mobile\
      \ phone platform, has already been successfully ported to netbooks(1). Further\
      \ advances could easily lead to netbooks being used a phone application development\
      \ platform, as well as a PDA, e-book reader, and smartphone replacement. The\
      \ latest trends of web-based applications and cloud computing also create a\
      \ unique market niche for netbooks as portable thin clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\
      With 10 years of experience in building computers preinstalled with open source\
      \ operating systems, eRacks is prepared to meet the demands of these trends.\
      \ &quot;eRacks has a strong reputation in providing customized rackmount servers.&quot;\
      \ remarked Joseph Wolff, CEO of eRacks, &quot;We welcome inquiries for production\
      \ runs of specialized OSes including Google&#39;s Android, on any of our netbooks.&quot;</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\teRacks netbooks come with Ubuntu or Fedora Linux preinstalled and\
      \ include Open Office, an office suite of software, containing document, spreadsheet,\
      \ and presentation software, compatible with both standard and Microsoft formats.\
      \ Webcams and card readers are also standard on eRacks netbooks. eRacks netbooks\

      \ Source Systems announced a new desktop model that uses the recently-released,\
      \ highly-acclaimed Intel Core i7 processor. The Core i7 CPU&#39;s architectural\
      \ improvements include an integrated memory controller that doubles or even\
      \ triples the peak memory bandwidth compared to other top of the line processors.\
      \ To a user, this means increased multithreading performance, which is ideal\
      \ for computationally-intensive applications including serious digital media\
      \ creation, multi-application workloads, and heavy-duty gaming. Other Core i7\
      \ advances include a dynamic energy management, improving efficiency and energy\
      \ utilization. While most desktops&#39; maximum memory is 4-8 GB, the eRacks/i7DESK\
      \ DDR3 system holds up to 24 GB. eRacks tailors the hardware configuration of\
      \ each system to the user&#39;s specifications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEach eRacks\
      \ computer also comes with a customizable set of open source software. Linux\
      \ has long dominated the server market, and is now among the fastest growing\
      \ operating systems in the desktop world. Improved security and performance,\
      \ ease of installation of applications, and freedom from licensing restrictions\
      \ are just a few of the advantages that Linux has over other more costly proprietary\
      \ operating systems. The eRacks/i7DESK default configuration includes software\
      \ such as Open Office, a suite of applications similar to Microsoft Office.\
      \ Unlike MS Office, Open Office is compatible with many other office software\
      \ formats, including older MS Office formats.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/i7DESK\
      \ is currently the only commercially available desktop computer configured with\
      \ a wide choice of Linux flavors, including Ubuntu Linux. Extensive customization\
      \ options include a choice of two i7-compatible motherboards, a &#39;quietization&#39;\
      \ option, multiple graphics cards, and SSD drives. The price starts at $2095\
      \ and includes configuration. The eRacks/i7DESK is available online:</p>\r\n\

      \ since 1999, announces eRacks Hosting, a new division that will consolidate\
      \ its dedicated hosting and colocation services. The eRacks Hosting facilities\
      \ occupy racks in multiple Tier 1 datacenters in Silicon Valley, California,\
      \ where the Internet backbone and peering are ranked among the top in the world.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\teRacks has previously offered hosting and colocation to a select\
      \ group of customers. Demand for these services has risen sharply in recent\
      \ years, as organizations have embraced the idea of outsourcing network operations\
      \ due to concerns of security, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. In response,\
      \ eRacks has decided to extend and formalize its offerings, by creating eRacks\
      \ Hosting, and launching an e-commerce website www.eRacksHosting.com.</p>\r\n\
      <p>\r\n\teRacks Hosting offers service in 3 levels: Standard, Professional and\
      \ Enterprise, in addition to its customized packages. Base prices start at $129\
      \ monthly for a Core 2 Duo system (Standard plan). Dual-core (Professional plan)\
      \ and quad-core systems (Enterprise plan) are also available. Service can be\
      \ billed monthly, or yearly at a substantial discount. eRacks has long been\
      \ an enthusiastic advocate of open source solutions, and offers systems configured\
      \ with the clients&#39; choices of open source operating systems, including:\
      \ Ubuntu Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Red Hat Linux,\
      \ SuSE Linux, and others. eRacks Hosting offers additional services, including\
      \ installation and configuration of a set of virtualized servers on the client&#39;s\
      \ dedicated server, as well as software development services. In addition, CPUs,\
      \ hard drives and memory can be upgraded from the base configuration, and other\
      \ customization is available. Further details can be found at www.eRacksHosting.com,\
      \ where customers can explore their options and order directly online.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We have been offering customized hosting and colocation services\
      \ for several years, and we are pleased to formally offer these services under\
      \ the eRacks Hosting name. This will position us to continue expanding in this\
      \ space without sacrificing the personalized support our customers expect.&quot;\
      \ says Joseph Wolff, CEO and Founder of eRacks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks Hosting\
      \ technical staff has extensive experience with both customization and virtualization.\
      \ A recent project with Libre Hosting involved the development of a web-based\
      \ virtualization infrastructure based on the Open Source Kernel Virtual Machine\
      \ (KVM), which is built into the Linux kernel. Joseph Wolff adds, &quot;We think\
      \ that our customers will be delighted by how easy and economical it is to set\
      \ themselves up with one of our complete hosting plans through eRacksHosting.com.\

      \n\tOctober 19, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThanks to Canonical&#39;s System Builder\
      \ Program, pre-installed Ubuntu Linux PCs are available throughout the world\
      \ and not just from Dell.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEveryone in the Linux desktop world\
      \ knows that Dell now offers Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on some of its laptops and desktops.\
      \ Some also know that Dell will soon be offering the latest Ubuntu, 7.10, on\
      \ its systems. Dell, however, is far from the only PC builder that offers Ubuntu\
      \ to its customers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn March, London-based Canonical, Ubuntu&#39;s\
      \ commercial sponsor, started its Partner Program to drive awareness and adoption\
      \ of business-ready, open-source server platforms and desktop solutions. Canonical\
      \ offers five partner tracks. One of them, the System Builder Program, is for\
      \ dedicated OEMs, white-box builders and system integrators that want to pre-load\
      \ their computers--desktops, laptops or servers--with Ubuntu.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\
      \tMaria Bonnefon, Canonical&#39;s OEM program manager, explained, &quot;We are\
      \ mainly looking into replacing FreeDOS with a full operating system [that]\
      \ is stable, reliable, secure and virtually virus-free. There are no licensing\
      \ fees, and no additional charges for security or maintenance updates. All these\
      \ elements mixed together make it so that Ubuntu becomes an ideal solution to\
      \ serve a demand on desktops, laptops, servers and in even mobile devices. It\
      \ fills a need for companies who wish to commercialize a complete solution in\
      \ their PCs without having to make a substantial investment.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\
      \n\tWith this program, &quot;Canonical has established direct presence in focus\
      \ countries including Brazil, Russia, India, China and Taiwan. This allows us\
      \ to do proper follow-through in the channel, with timely support on-site. It\
      \ also accelerates our response time to our partners, utilizing a local infrastructure\
      \ and communicating in the local language. It gives us the possibility [of being]\
      \ close to the partner to really plan and advance hand in hand.&quot;</p>\r\n\
      <p>\r\n\tSo it is that you can get pre-installed Ubuntu with Canonical support\
      \ from companies like Excimer and NT Computers in Russia, Navigator in the Ukraine,\
      \ Inspur in China, and PC House in Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCanonical also\
      \ has Ubuntu system builders in English-speaking countries. These include EfficientPC\
      \ in the United Kingdom and eRacks Open Source Systems and System76 in the United\
      \ States. Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth said other companies that are not\
      \ official Canonical partners also sell Ubuntu-powered systems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\
      \n\tCanonical offers its partners several services, which include:</p>\r\n<p>\r\
      \n\t&middot;&nbsp;Configuration support for system builders with the option\
      \ to make additional revenue by reselling Canonical support;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Specialized\
      \ training for technical and sales teams;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Pre-sales\
      \ support;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Hardware certification with access to Ubuntu\
      \ logo use and promotion on Canonical&#39;s Web site;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Strong\
      \ support in the education sector, with a specific operating system adapted\
      \ to that market--Edubuntu;<br />\r\n\t&middot;&nbsp;Operating support for Classmate\
      \ PC, a project currently being developed jointly with Intel; and<br />\r\n\t\
      &middot;&nbsp;Customization assistance to completely personalize a solution\
      \ with applications, logos and sound support, as done for the Ubuntu Mobile\
      \ core on the Mobile Internet Device.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We are delighted\
      \ to see a number of top local OEMs adhering to the program on a global basis,&quot;\
      \ Bonnefon said. &quot;We are very satisfied with the progress made thus far,\
      \ and believe there is still a long way to go.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn particular,\
      \ Bonnefon noted, &quot;The number of first-time computer users within emerging\
      \ markets is huge and acceptance of an operating system that is different more\
      \ viable. Also, these are users that would be more sensitive to pricing.&quot;</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tLooking ahead, &quot;We believe that we are only at the beginning\
      \ of an inevitable turn in the way people perceive a Linux OS,&quot; she said.\
      \ And, as for the business side of delivering Ubuntu-powered desktops and laptops,\
      \ &quot;We will continue to listen closely to the channel, conceive and adapt\
      \ services per demand, and develop solutions that best fit the needs of our\
      \ partners,&quot; Bonnefon concluded.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&mdash;Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols</p>\r\

      \n\tOrange, CA, USA<br />\r\n\tFebruary 27, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks offers\
      \ a new donation pathway to The OpenBSD Project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe increasing\
      \ popularity of open source software is changing how businesses interact. A\
      \ growing number of businesses depend on open source software projects as part\
      \ of their infrastructure or their product and services. It makes sense that\
      \ such corporations find a way to empower those projects. eRacks Open Source\
      \ Systems is doing exactly that.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOpen Source software projects\
      \ are typically funded solely by donations from grateful users. Since eRacks\
      \ incorporates open source software in nearly all of its computers, it makes\
      \ sense for the company to construct a new avenue for donations. eRacks&#39;\
      \ customers are now easily able to make a donation toward the OpenBSD Project\
      \ along with the purchase of an eRacks rackmount server, with the simple click\
      \ of a dropdown choice.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks specializes in open source installations\
      \ and has shipped configured OpenBSD systems since 1999, to a loyal and growing\
      \ customer base. Because the software is open source, a user has full control\
      \ of his application, and is not subject to license fees, renewals, and restrictions.\
      \ Moreover, customization is possible without needing to purchase rights to\
      \ the code.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOpenBSD is a Unix-like operating system, well-known\
      \ for both its high security and reliability. It has been particularly successful\
      \ at avoiding default security holes, and has an exceptionally rigorous auditing\
      \ process. OpenBSD is freely redistributable under the open source BSD license.\
      \ Typical applications that are best suited to run on OpenBSD are those that\
      \ require strong security such as bastion hosts, intrusion detection, perimeter\
      \ firewalls, bandwidth managers, mail filter gateways, VPN (Virtual Private\
      \ Network), DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone), NAT (Network Address Translation), and\
      \ DNS (Domain Name Server) servers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe OpenBSD project also\
      \ authors OpenSSH, which is crucial to management of large data centers. OpenSSH\
      \ is a free implementation of the IETF-standardized SSH connectivity protocol\
      \ connectivity toolset that allow functions like file transfers and remote login.\
      \ This is an essential improvement over the older tools such as telnet, rlogin,\
      \ and ftp, where the user&#39;s password is transmitted unencrypted. OpenSSH&#39;s\
      \ encryption routines eliminate password snooping, eavesdropping, connection\
      \ hijacking, and other attacks. OpenSSH is the most widely used implementation\
      \ of the SSH protocol, and is included in products from IBM, Apple, HP, Sun,\
      \ and Cisco.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe OpenBSD project and OpenSSH are both coordinated\
      \ in Canada by Theo de Raadt, while the development team is globally distributed.\
      \ Because OpenBSD is officially based in Canada and avoids restrictive U.S.\
      \ cryptography export laws, the developers have been able to embed cryptographic\
      \ components in numerous places within the operating system, increasing its\
      \ security. The OpenBSD Project is funded solely by donations and sales of its\
      \ CDs and Tshirts. &quot;The OpenBSD project is impressed by the novel approach\
      \ eRacks has taken, which allows their customers to easily contribute towards\
      \ the open source software which will operate on their servers. eRacks&#39;\
      \ customers should take careful note of how this enlightened approach attempts\
      \ to make sure that the OpenBSD and OpenSSH projects are better funded, and\
      \ thus able to continue innovating these free products which much of the industry\
      \ so heavily depends on.&quot; notes Theo De Raadt, coordinator of the OpenBSD\
      \ and OpenSSH Projects.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;eRacks is proud to provide a route\
      \ for donations to the OpenBSD Project. Rock-solid security is a top priority\
      \ for most of our customers; OpenBSD provides this.&quot; comments Joseph Wolff,\
      \ CEO of eRacks Open Source Systems. &quot;Our corporate customers have already\
      \ realized the advantages of utilizing reliable and secure open source software\
      \ in their critical business processes.&quot; eRacks&#39; future plans include\
      \ expanding its donation program to other segments of the open source community.\
      \ It is in the best interest of a corporation to contribute back to the community\
      \ on which it depends, insist eRacks&#39; managers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout eRacks:<br\

      \t\t<h4>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tServer Quietization<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\tReducing The Hum\
      \ Of Servers Without Sacrificing Quality</h4>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\
      \t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe hum of a server is a sign of two things:\
      \ that there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of power inside the enclosure, and\
      \ that the fans are working overtime to make sure there are no excessive heat\
      \ problems, which can cause crashes&mdash;or worse. Yet for anyone who works\
      \ in a smaller data center or even keeps a row of servers close at hand in an\
      \ office cubicle, server hum can be distracting and make it hard to hear when\
      \ talking on the phone, for instance. Not every data center is situated in a\
      \ server room where you can occasionally check on system status and run admin\
      \ utilities. Instead, you might have a server right under your desk.</p>\r\n\
      <h5>\r\n\tQuiet Down!</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tServer quietization is one of the key\
      \ issues for small to midsized enterprises, a problem that a larger enterprise\
      \ rarely needs to address. For the most part, the issue has become more noticeable\
      \ as power output has increased and data centers rely on more and more servers\
      \ to run the business. Server manufacturers use several methods to make servers\
      \ operate as quietly as possible.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFan placement, low-decibel\
      \ fans, heatpipes, watercooling, and optimized airflow inside the chassis can\
      \ all help reduce noise. Fanless systems, which are much more expensive and\
      \ use an array of heatsinks, heatpipes, and other cooling methods, also provide\
      \ an innovative approach.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Small to medium-sized companies\
      \ tend to utilize tower-based platforms that are often colocated with employees,\
      \ so noise levels can greatly affect productivity in these environments,&rdquo;\
      \ says Christina Tiner, group manager of Industry Standard Server product marketing\
      \ at HP (www.hp.com). &ldquo;Mechanical designs of the servers greatly impact\
      \ acoustics. Fan location and airflow patterns determine the amount of air required\
      \ to cool the system.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;The latest trend is to make\
      \ sure that the air path from the front of the system to the processor is as\
      \ clear as possible,&rdquo; adds Ken Haugen, the director of server engineering\
      \ at Gateway Computers (www.gateway.com). &ldquo;Any active component other\
      \ than a fan in that air path will preheat or slow down the air path, forcing\
      \ the fan to run faster to keep the processor cool and make more noise. Other\
      \ trends in keeping servers quiet include counter-rotating fans, thicker and\
      \ slower fans, and larger processor heatsinks. Finally, the latest-generation\
      \ processors use much less power than previous generations, which decreases\
      \ the thermal load and allows the system to run quieter. Some manufacturers\
      \ also use liquid cooling, but this adds too much cost for most applications\
      \ and is less reliable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaugen notes that companies that\
      \ situate servers near employees should look for server manufacturers that design\
      \ quiet servers, relying on low-decibel fans and highly optimized CPUs that\
      \ are designed for whisper-quiet operation. He notes that some server rack manufacturers\
      \ have designed cabinets that use sound-dampening techniques, but the heat output\
      \ and power drain for these cabinets sometimes negates their value.</p>\r\n\
      <h5>\r\n\tThe Marketplace For Quiet Servers</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne company that\
      \ specializes in quiet servers is eRacks Open Source Systems (eracks.com), which\
      \ offers products designed for smaller companies that may not have a server\
      \ room. There are two main product offerings for low-decibel servers: those\
      \ with a fanless design that are fully silent and those that are quietized with\
      \ optimally placed, low-noise fans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Placement and location\
      \ of internal fans is key, and we select and specify only certain chassis designs\
      \ which meet our criteria for fan placement and location to avoid or minimize\
      \ auditory noise leakage from the chassis,&rdquo; says Joseph J. Wolff, eRacks&rsquo;\
      \ CTO and founder. &ldquo;We also use only the best available noncontact fan\
      \ technology, and at the lowest fan RPMs possible, to drastically reduce the\
      \ noise produced by each individual fan, usually to about 1/10 of the original\
      \ decibel level output.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNixsys (www.nixsys.com) is another\
      \ company that has received customer requests for fanless and low-noise servers.\
      \ Nicolas Szczedrin, a Nixsys spokesperson, says the requests sometimes come\
      \ from small multimedia companies and recording studios that require servers\
      \ with high processing power, yet the companies don&rsquo;t want to disrupt\
      \ any of their daily activities. He says one partial solution is to use a chassis\
      \ for a server that can automatically regulate fans for low-decibel operation,\
      \ but he says the trade-off is in the extra heat buildup.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;We\
      \ have had more acceptance with quiet fans because they are very quiet, and\
      \ if they are well-designed and tested properly, you can use a very large range\
      \ of processors and components, making the systems more powerful, easy to upgrade,\
      \ and lower cost,&rdquo; Szczedrin says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShuttle (www.shuttle.com)\
      \ also makes systems that operate at low decibels and can be used as servers.\
      \ Its XPC-SB83G2B system uses a silent power supply, an &ldquo;integrated cooling\
      \ engine&rdquo; to manage airflow, and fans that change their speed depending\
      \ on the processor requirements. Shuttle systems have the added advantage for\
      \ smaller companies in that the chassis is remarkably small.</p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\
      \tServer Or Rack Issue?</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost server manufacturers agree that\
      \ quietization is mostly a server issue, not a rack issue. If the server itself\
      \ is noisy, sound-dampening racks typically just obstruct airflow. Some companies,\
      \ such as NEC (www.nec.com) and eRacks, do have rackmountable servers that use\
      \ liquid cooling, so they operate in near silence. These liquid-cooled, rackmount\
      \ servers are typically more expensive but operate at the lowest decibels possible.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tAccording to eRacks&rsquo; Wolff, &ldquo;We can centralize the pump,\
      \ tank, and cooling infrastructure for a rack of multiple servers using manifold\
      \ technology.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the end, running a quiet server has\
      \ many benefits for smaller companies. It means a server room is less of a requirement\
      \ down the road, and admins can keep systems in the same office and have easy\
      \ access to server utilities and monitoring software.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tby John\

      \n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe world of open-source software offers\
      \ reduced pricing and more relaxed licensing agreements, both good for smaller\
      \ businesses as well as large enterprise-level operations. As Unix gains in\
      \ popularity and requires some technical acumen, companies selling turnkey Unix\
      \ workstations and server systems are fulfilling a very real need.</p>\r\n<p>\r\
      \n\teRacks Open Source Systems is offering ready-to-run desktop and server systems\
      \ loaded with various versions of the open source, Linux-based Ubuntu operating\
      \ system. This Linux distribution is derived from Debian Linux.</p>\r\n<p>\r\
      \n\tAmong its various offerings, the company has recently finished testing a\
      \ new model: eRacks/FOCUS, a truly noiseless high-power AMD64 workstation. Another\
      \ new product offering from the company is the eRacks/LITE system, a shallow-depth\
      \ (13-inch) 1U rackmount system. The system has been optimized for low noise\
      \ output. The LITE system has been engineered for environments where space is\
      \ at a premium, as well as shops where noise must be kept to a minimum such\
      \ as for audio-/video-editing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor many work settings, sound\
      \ generation from the machine can be a major issue. According to Britta Serog\
      \ with eRacks Open Source Systems marketing, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve developed many\
      \ different &lsquo;quietized&rsquo; systems on customers&rsquo; requests. Machine\
      \ noise is a bigger problem than the big computer manufacturers realize. Not\
      \ everyone can put their rackmount systems into a soundproof server room; many\
      \ systems are used for audio applications, such as video-editing, radio broadcast,\
      \ hospital data management, etc.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe competition for\
      \ eRacks comes from some of the major computer manufacturers, as well as various\
      \ Unix providers. Serog says, &ldquo;These include the big players, namely Dell,\
      \ HP, etc. But these companies generally don&rsquo;t offer the degree of customization\
      \ that eRacks does, especially in terms of operating system choice, as well\
      \ as system quietization. Smaller players that compete concentrating on open-source\
      \ operating systems include Pogo Linux [www.pogolinux.com] and Penguin Computing\
      \ [www.penguincomputing.com], but these companies typically offer only varieties\
      \ of Red Hat and SuSE Linux and tend to ignore OpenBSD and other open-source\
      \ operating systems.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks is currently offering the\
      \ following Ubuntu distributions: Ubuntu Server; Edubuntu for educational uses;\
      \ Kubuntu, which is based on KDE environment; and Xubuntu for low-end systems\
      \ and thin clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to providing custom turnkey\
      \ hardware platforms, eRacks will install drivers and various software on request\
      \ and provides consulting, network configuration, and open-source enterprise\
      \ migration planning.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tby Joe Lazzaro</p>\r\n", created: !!timestamp '2012-10-25

      \ and not be governed by licensing restrictions and third-party proprietary\
      \ lock-in. Ubuntu and other varieties of Linux come with a suite of free (libre)\
      \ open source software including email, office and even graphics applications.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tUbuntu, whose tagline is &#39;Linux for Human Beings&#39;, strongly\
      \ focuses on usability. It is derived from Debian Linux, inheriting its convenient\
      \ update methods of synaptic and apt-get. Other Ubuntu distributions include\
      \ Edubuntu aimed at school use, Kubuntu based on KDE (K Desktop Environment),\
      \ and Xubuntu using Xfce Desktop for low-end systems and thin-clients. The Ubuntu\
      \ Server is secure by default, has no open ports after installation, and contains\
      \ only essential server software. eRacks offers customization in software installations,\
      \ and can install the Server Edition, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu, as well\
      \ as bleeding-edge or legacy versions. eRacks also takes advantage of Ubuntu&#39;s\
      \ multiverse repository to install hardware drivers and software such as Java,\
      \ Flash, and Real Audio on request.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA new version of Ubuntu\
      \ is released every six months, and has security update support for minimally\
      \ 18 months, to 5 years for some versions such as Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server (long\
      \ term support). Because of its rapidly growing popularity, the Ubuntu community\
      \ is strong, and resources can be easily found. Canonical Ltd, the lead sponsors\
      \ of Ubuntu, offers commercial enterprise-class support. Ubuntu web forums and\
      \ IRC channels exist in many countries, and a searchable wiki dedicated to Ubuntu\
      \ is found at wiki.ubuntu.com. Along with the computer hardware, eRacks Open\
      \ Source Systems also offers software consulting, network configuration, as\
      \ well as open source enterprise migration planning.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCustomized\

      \ CA -</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the most vulnerable points of a corporate network\
      \ is its firewall, yet many large businesses are ill-equipped to ensure seamless,\
      \ uninterrupted operation in the event of its failure. A typical corporate network&#39;s\
      \ firewall system can be a single point of failure. If down, users on both sides\
      \ of the firewall, inside and out, would be unable to access email or Internet\
      \ until the firewall system has been repaired. In many corporate environments,\
      \ this would likely be at great expense and frustration. System administrators\
      \ and computer users: take heart. There is a better way to do firewalls, as\
      \ eRacks Open Source Systems has announced their low-cost solution to this risk:\
      \ the eRacks/TWINGUARD.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/TWINGUARD is a redundant,\
      \ dual-firewall system enclosed in a single, compact 1.75 inch shallow-depth\
      \ rackmount chassis. It comes preconfigured with a tried and true combination\
      \ of secure open-source software to achieve redundancy, including OpenBSD and\
      \ CARP. Two completely independent systems reside in one chassis: two power\
      \ supplies, two hard drives and two motherboards - all of which are industry-standard\
      \ components. Now, with the eRacks/TWINGUARD, in the event of a firewall failure,\
      \ the secondary firewall automatically assumes the role of the primary and all\
      \ network traffic flows uninterrupted. All of this would happen in the blink\
      \ of an eye, and users would not even know that their day was saved by the eRacks/TWINGUARD.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tWhen high availability and fault-tolerant hardware is a requirement,\
      \ the eRacks/TWINGUARD is an extremely effective and scalable solution. System\
      \ administrators have complete control over the configuration and can obtain\
      \ updates without any licensing fees because the firewall system is solely based\
      \ on open source software. Technical support is freely available in online open\
      \ source user communities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor a detailed description of the\
      \ eRacks/TWINGUARD, please visit: <a href=\"http://eracks.com/products/Firewall%20Servers/config?sku=TWINGUARD\"\
      >http://eracks.com/products/Firewall%20Servers/config?sku=TWINGUARD</a></p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tIn a nutshell, the eRacks/TWINGUARD is the ultimate in firewalls.\
      \ Not only is it a space-saving, fail-safe system, but it is also built with\
      \ non-proprietary components, equipped with robust, proven open-source software,\
      \ and founded on the rock-solid security of OpenBSD. Most importantly, it is\
      \ crafted by a system integrator well-versed in open-source solutions: eRacks\
      \ Open Source Systems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout eRacks:<br />\r\n\teRacks Open\

      \ increasing the accessibility of open source solutions to the SMB market (small\
      \ and midrange businesses). Leasing a suite of rackmount servers is now possible\
      \ for as little as $68 a month, with rates dependent on quantity and type of\
      \ systems leased, length of lease, and credit approval. A lease assumes and\
      \ manages the risk of equipment ownership. Leasing allows businesses to meet\
      \ their technology needs quickly without an up-front investment and also offers\
      \ significant tax advantages.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEnabling the enterprise by bringing\
      \ control back to businesses is eRacks&#39; mission. eRacks&#39; systems are\
      \ built with high-quality non-proprietary industry-standard hardware components,\
      \ so that their computers are easily upgradable. By offering open source operating\
      \ systems and applications already configured, eRacks encourages businesses\
      \ to limit their reliance on third-party closed-source software vendors for\
      \ key applications, avoiding vendor lock-in. Increased security and reliability\
      \ are also two important reasons why many major institutions choose to run their\
      \ network infrastructure using open source software.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>It&#39;s\
      \ all about control.</i><br />\r\n\tProprietary software often forces users&#39;\
      \ business decisions by limiting interoperability with outside products, and\
      \ requiring upgrade schedules. Infrastructure expansion and scalability may\
      \ also be threatened, remaining dependent on proprietary software licenses.\
      \ Using open source software, the business owner maintains control of the development\
      \ of key business operations and is not dependent on an outside software vendor.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\teRacks&#39; winning combination of leasing arrangements, open source\
      \ software, and easily-upgradable hardware, offers unbeatable value to both\

      \ Open Source Systems today announces the availability of a quad-CPU 64-bit\
      \ computing powerhouse, the eRacks/QUADOPT. Memory and data-intensive applications\
      \ such as CAD, animation/rendering, financial and scientific modeling all benefit\
      \ from 64-bit computing because the AMD OpteronTM processor has 1 terabyte of\
      \ addressable memory compared to only 4 gigabytes by 32-bit processors. The\
      \ Opteron architecture also provides a seamless migration path to 64-bit computing,\
      \ enabling users to run existing 32-bit code.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks fuels the\
      \ trend to 64-bit computing in the open source arena, by providing the hardware\
      \ already configured and tested with the customer&#39;s choice of 64-bit operating\
      \ systems. Already proven to run even legacy 32-bit applications faster than\
      \ 32-bit CPUs, the move to 64-bits is now more compelling than ever.</p>\r\n\
      <p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/QUADOPT is housed in a 4U chassis, and comes complete with\
      \ four 800-series Opteron CPUs, dual Gigabit Ethernet, single 10/100 LAN, U320\
      \ SCSI, and redundant 500W power supplies. The eRacks/QUADOPT is priced competitively\
      \ beginning at $9995. For more information, visit eRacks&#39; website at http://eRacks.com.</p>\r\

      \ to select from a live list of software packages to be installed on their server\
      \ at the time they place their order. eRacks offers a finely-tuned Zope web\

      \ official website for the Zope community.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks management\
      \ has indicated that this new level of customization is the beginning of an\
      \ exciting, new trend that enables customers to completely customize their hardware\
      \ and software preferences. Joseph Wolff, founder of eRacks explains, &quot;Our\
      \ goal at eRacks is to return control of technology to the enterprise, freeing\
      \ our customers from critical dependence on third-party software vendors, and\
      \ lowering both their cost and risk. This is why we promote open source software\
      \ and customize our servers to such a fine degree. We want to provide that head-start\
      \ advantage to our customers.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn keeping with eRacks&#39;\
      \ philosophy, the eRacks/ZOPE application server is designed for high-performance\
      \ and reliability. The server is customized to include any set of Zope packages,\
      \ as well as other configurable components. The company&#39;s experience with\
      \ Zope extends from its own web server to numerous enterprise-level implementations.\
      \ Zope is a Python-based web application server. It features a transactional\
      \ object database, stores both content and code, and enables fully dynamic web\
      \ pages. Its tight security capabilities enable granular permission control\

      \ basic set of site building tools. These include connectors to relational databases\
      \ and other external data sources, issue tracking, and e-commerce among others.</p>\r\

      Laguna Beach, CA - Building on its popular eRacks/QUIET rackmount server line,\
      \ eRacks Open Source Systems this week unveiled the high-performance SILENCE\
      \ tower and Quiet GBOX, a modified version of the hot-selling cube desktop GBOX.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tEspecially designed for noise-sensitive business environments, the\
      \ original QUIET rackmount server has made its way into recording studios, corporate\
      \ boardrooms, and home entertainment theaters across the country. With the arrival\
      \ of the SILENCE and the compact Quiet GBOX, eRacks extends its reach beyond\
      \ the boardroom and home entertainment theaters and into virtually all work\
      \ environments that desire or require low noise computing. Universities, public\
      \ libraries, government offices, graphic designers, lawyers, architects, engineers,\
      \ and even students can now benefit from eRacks&#39; Quiet Technology.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/QUIET, SILENCE, and Quiet GBOX are all measured to run\
      \ within 5 decibels above the baseline quiet room measurement of 28-30dB. The\
      \ SILENCE is 2 dB above baseline, the Quiet GBOX cube comes in at 3dB above\
      \ baseline, and the 1U-height rackmount QUIET is just 4-5 dB above baseline.</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tThe eRacks/SILENCE tower server employs a rubber gasket around its\
      \ front door and sound-deadening foam inside the top and sides. The sleek Pentium4\
      \ aluminum system is customizable both in choice of hardware as well as operating\
      \ system. Test measurements, pictures, and more information on the SILENCE as\

      <p>\r\n\t<a href=\"/press\">Press Release</a></p>\r\n<h5>\r\n\teRacks Preconfigured\
      \ Rackmount Systems Focus on Open Source Software.</h5>\r\n<h5>\r\n\t<em>Laguna\
      \ Beach, CA (April 20, 2001) --</em></h5>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs many administrators\
      \ know, setting up a network can be an overwhelming task. Designing the layout,\
      \ purchasing the hardware and software, and configuring everything must take\
      \ into account the latest in security technology.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks offers\
      \ custom-tailored rackmount servers to network designers and provides them with\
      \ a some helpful advice as to what would best suit their needs. For instance,\
      \ eRacks experts, may advise a network designer to use the OpenBSD operating\
      \ system in his or her firewall machines because of its superior reliabilty\
      \ and well-tested security. And since eRacks servers arrive preconfigured, software\
      \ configuration is kept to a minimum.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe use of open source\
      \ software is certainly not new to the Internet. According to Opensource.Org,\
      \ &quot;Apache runs over 50% of the world&#39;s web servers&quot; currently,\
      \ and that sendmail is &quot;the most important and widely used email transport\
      \ software on the Internet.&quot; The OpenBSD operating system is designed with\
      \ security as a priority, and the website proclaims that its operating system\
      \ has enjoyed &quot;three years without a remote hole in the default install.&quot;\
      \ An open source code policy permits very fast bug fixes, while proprietary\
      \ source code updates usually have a much higher turn-around time. Free distribution\
      \ ensures the high quality of the software; there is no temptation for a vendor\
      \ to release an early buggy release in order to achieve a few short-term sales</p>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\tBy primarily using open source software in its systems, eRacks is\
      \ able to offer custom-built ready-to-run systems at both low prices as well\
      \ as high levels of reliability and security.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd unlike most\
      \ competitiors, eRacks&#39; rackmount system prices are very competitive. The\
      \ company builds servers designed using industry-standard components, unlike\
      \ many big-name servers, which contain proprietary components that are only\
      \ upgradable at high costs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\teRacks.com offers prospective customers\
      \ easy navigation to the system category of their choise. Visitors can even\
      \ configure and order the systems right off the Web site.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor\
      \ more information visit eRacks.com.</p>\r\n<h6>\r\n\tAbout the company</h6>\r\
      \n<p>\r\n\teRacks is managed by a small group of experienced network designers\
      \ and system architects. The company was officially founded in the 3rd quarter\
      \ of 2000, and has close ties with a team of security consultants, SecurityArchitects.\
      \ Bringing over 20 years of software and system design experience to the company,\
      \ Joseph Wolff is the Chief Technologist and founder of eRacks. Joe remarks,\
      \ &quot;Our goal at eRacks is to provide a needed service to system administrators\
      \ and network designers, as well as to promote high-quality open source software.&quot;</p>\r\
